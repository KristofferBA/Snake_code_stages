# Snake_code_stages
Snapshots of the code as it is developed.
* 1.0 is the bread and butter, sort of a profe of concept. It is just creating the game window, colouring it, drawing the snake head and moving it around using keybinds.
* 2.0 is where the code i partially being converted into OOP using classes and functions.
* 3.0 is when the time aspect is added alowing the snake head to move automaticly, the ability to pause movement is added using "SPACE" and the code is further onverted into OOP.
* 4.0 is gonna be when the snake gets its body.
* 5.0 is when the apples with randomized location will be added to the game allowing the snake to grow as part of the gameplay.
* 6.0 is when obstacles will be added to the game, and where the option of loosing the game becomes possible.
